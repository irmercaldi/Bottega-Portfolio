<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After 10 years split between working as a firefighter and as an Infantryman in the United State Army, I decided that I wanted a change. After much deliberation, I packed up, moved 2500+ miles away from the place I called home, and found myself enrolling in the February 2017 cohort at Bottega Tech.</p>
